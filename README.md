EduBlock: A Secure Blockchain Solution for Academic Certificate Verification

EduBlock is a decentralized application designed to authenticate academic certificates using blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized features of blockchain, EduBlock ensures that certificates are tamper-proof, transparent, and easily verifiable by employers, academic institutions, and other stakeholders.


 🚀 Features

- Immutable Records: Once a certificate is issued, its record on the blockchain is permanent and cannot be altered or deleted.
- Easy Verification: Verifiers can check certificate authenticity without intermediaries or manual processes.
- Decentralized Storage: Reduces risk of central database failures and data breaches by using IPFS.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for institutions to issue certificates and for employers to verify them.

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity
- Smart Contracts: Deployed using Truffle Suite
- Storage: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storing certificate files
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Database: MongoDB
